A lot of people feel trapped in a never ending barrage of things to do. Their to-do lists continue to expand regardless of how much gets accomplished. They are scrambling most of the time. A typical example is the working mom who has to get from her work to the kids’ soccer practice, then off to the ballet recital. Back home to cook dinner, ensure the kids do their homework, put the kids to bed and tidy up, then go to bed. 

When you stop and think about it, do you really have to do any of that stuff? 

One might say I have to provide for my family. I need food and a roof over my head. So I have to work to earn enough money, at least for the basics. After all I have to live. 

**Living is a choice**

The honest truth is we don't have to live. We don’t have to eat and we don't have to provide for our families. We do it because we want to live and we want to care for our loved ones. 

**Do you want to or have to:**

  * Take care of your partner/spouse, parent, child ...etc.?
  * Be a hard working employee or a dedicated boss?
  * Be a loyal friend?
  * Support your colleagues and co-workers?

We choose to do most, if not all, of the things in our lives. As morbid as this may sound; living is a choice. There are people who choose to end their own lives. We all have the ability to end our lives but our desire for living is stronger. 

We live because we desire to do so and we choose to have a good quality of life. 

**Choice is freedom** 

Take away the sense of obligation from everything you do and think about it as an option. 

Living with choices is freedom. You can do what you would like to do and when you want to do it.  You can say yes or no to anything based on what you desire. 

**With choices comes clarity** 

The biggest changes with the most impact can come from a tiny shift in perspective. If you recognize all the things you do as choices you make, you start thinking and acting differently. 

You can focus on what you want to do for yourself and your family. When you are clear about your desires, you can simply choose not to do the things that don’t matter to you. 

It is amazing how much you can eliminate when you talk with others and find out that they are OK with foregoing some stuff and activities. They did it in the past because they thought it was expected of them. 

As you become more clear about your own desires and choices,  you gain more experience in simplifying your life and doing what matters. 

**An appreciation for ability** 

The other side of choice is the ability to do something. If you want to do something and you can do it, then you are set. 

Being thankful for your abilities will make doing anything worthwhile. 

**Aren’t you lucky to be able to:**

  * Take care of your partner/spouse, parent, child ...etc.?
  * Be a hard working employee or a dedicated boss?
  * Be a loyal friend?
  * Support your colleagues and co-workers?

**Action rooted in gratitude can be a source of joy** 

The freedom of choice combined with an appreciation of our own abilities can turn everything we do into enjoyable and meaningful action. We then become one with life.
