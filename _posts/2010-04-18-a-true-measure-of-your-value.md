From early childhood, my parents instilled in me the importance of education. If you are not educated, you will not get a job and you will not be of value. I grew up feeling that my value is derived from good grades and later from a good paying job. 

Other metrics of value were added to my own from what I learned over the years and from friends and family: If you are not thin, you will have a hard time finding love. If you don't have a lot of money, you won't be able to impact the world. If you don't pay taxes, you are a burden to society. And so on. 

Much later in life when I decided to leave my career behind and explore what life had in store for me, I realized that the metrics of value in our society are flawed. They are subjective and materialistic. I was the same person with or without my career and qualifications. 

The contributions that we place most value on are the ones we can measure with money, like: building hospitals and schools or feeding thousands of starving children. There is nothing wrong with that and it's admirable. But to think that the rest of humanity does not have an impact is false—plain and simple.

Our collective existence is what shapes our experiences. There are so many variables but none of which should create more value to a human life than others. Life in and of itself is all the validation we need. 

**Your material contribution** 

If we want to look at our lives from a materialistic and physical contribution standpoint, why not consider the following? If you did not exist, 

  * your *parents* would spend less money
  * the *doctor* and *nurses* who helped bring you to this world would not have been paid
  * the retailers selling your food, clothing and toys would've *earned* less.
  * throughout the years, *doctors and clinics* would've earned less because they didn't treat you
  * less *books* would be bought or borrowed and read
  * less *movies* would be enjoyed, less *games* played or watched
  * all the *teachers* you had in your schools would be compensated less. Same with college *professors*
  * less *cars* would be bought, less distance *traveled*, less *money spent* on interests and life necessities.
  * less *food* would be enjoyed, less *candy* consumed, less *fun* had
  * less things would be *broken*, less things *fixed*
  * less *mess* made, less *cleanup*
  * less *school fundraising cookies* and candy bars sold, less *received*
  * less small [charitable work would be done](http://mashable.com/2010/04/17/social-good-micro-lending/), or less *accepted* from charity
  * your parents would have less *security* because you wouldn't be around to care for them as they age.

**How about all the not so material contributions?** 

If you didn't exist, 

  * your *parents* would not have experienced all the joy you've given them
  * your *siblings and friends* lives would never be the same without you
  * someone would've missed out on *loving you*
  * someone would've missed out on being *loved by you*
  * someone would’ve not been your *son or daughter* or niece or nephew
  * someone would miss out on *consoling you* and being your best friend
  * someone would *not have a best friend* who was there for them
  * some *pet* would miss out on your love and kindness
  * there would be less *laughter* in this world
  * there would be less *tears* in this world
  * the world would miss out on you *singing* in the shower
  * the world will not hear the *music* you wanted to play or the *words* you wanted to say
  * there will be *no memories* of you and how you were cherished
  * there would be less *fun* to be had, less *drama* to be experienced
  * there would be less *joy* and *pain*
  * there would be less *beauty* expressed in your perfection and imperfection.

Add all of the contributions mentioned above, and then some, multiply your total by 6 billion people, and we have a *world*. 

**Your value is in being and all that comes with it.** 

Without you, life will be missing a piece, a dance … an expression. 

We all will be forgotten one day after we are gone … life will move on … life will always be…  but it won’t be the same.
