> "Pretend that every single person you meet has a sign around his or her neck that says, 'Make me feel important.' Not only will you succeed in sales, you will succeed in life." ~Mary Kay Ash

A couple of months ago we decided to buy a new car. Our car was 14 years old and we felt it was the right time. We looked online then went and visited a dealership and got the expected car salesman's treatment. After more research we decided to go check out another local dealership that offered a good incentive for cleaner cars. 

Within a few minutes of looking around, a smiling woman came and greeted us. She didn't ask what car we were looking for but wanted to know about us and how we decided to check out Hyundai. Her name is Cindy. She speaks English with a heavy accent. We learned from her that she arrived in Vancouver a couple of years ago. She wanted to move to give her daughter a chance to have a more relaxed and fun future. 

Cindy came as a single mother with a child and didn't know anyone in the city. She is working as a car salesperson, rarely the profession for a woman. Cindy **doesn't know much about cars or finances.** But she **loves people** and it shows. 

We talked for a bit and told her what vehicles we were interested in. She showed us the models and then suggested we go for a test drive. She didn't come with us. We ended up buying the more expensive car (still in the compact category). We loved driving it. Cindy didn't have to do any hard selling. All she had to do was **give us a chance to choose and pay attention to what we were looking for.** 

When it came to the paperwork Cindy wasn't of much help. But no one cared. She got the manager to do that stuff and made sure that we were happy with the deal we got. 

That day we made the decision, paid a down payment and set a date for picking up the car. 

When we went to pick up the car and complete the gazillion documents that need to be signed and copied, Cindy was there. She talked with us and **made sure we were taken care of.** And we were! 

Before leaving, Cindy gave both of us, and a friend who came with us, souvenirs she brought with her from her last trip home. She insisted that we take something. A week later, she called to check if everything was ok with the car and to offer us a complimentary scratch pen for the new car. 

We went again to see Cindy and she was warm and welcoming. We got our pen and talked with her for a bit. We asked if we could take a picture with her and she enthusiastically agreed. She got the receptionist to take our picture. Everyone was smiling. Cindy gave us the biggest smile and walked to the door with us as we were leaving. 

I'm writing this with a big smile on my face. Cindy has no super powers or magical selling techniques. She is a **genuine human being who really enjoys other people and wants to be of service.** The lasting impression she left is: **the key to success as a sales person is to genuinely care about people and understand what they want, everything else is a consequence.** 

To your success!
