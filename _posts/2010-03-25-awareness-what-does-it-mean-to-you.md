Awareness is commonly used in reference to public knowledge or understanding of social or political issues. It is synonymous with public involvement and advocacy in support of a certain cause or movement. 

Awareness in the spiritual sense is hard to describe by the intellect. It encompasses knowledge and a lot more. 

> Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in awareness. ~ James Thurber

Awareness can mean different things. The use of language to define and describe the inner workings of our being has its limitations. Below is my attempt to describe awareness using various words (the meaning of which may be interpreted differently). 

**Awakening** 

Awakening is a slight shift in perception. It takes you out of life on automatic. When you awaken, you start becoming more present. You recognize yourself as the creator or the observer of your thoughts. You start separating yourself from your mind, your body and its physical attributes. 

Once you start awakening, there is no turning back. 

You get a glimpse of your true timeless existence. You start going through short bursts of being and observing in the midst of all the doing and reacting. 

**Attention (mindfulness, presence)** 

With frequent shifts into the present moment, you start paying more attention and being mindful of what is unfolding now. Your awakening moments start getting longer and intentional. 

Enjoyment of life starts with paying attention to what is. 

**Appreciation** 

With focus and attention, you are able to see everything clearly.  You start appreciating life and all of its wonder. 

> The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself. ~ Henry Miller:

You experience peaceful living and true joy. 

**Knowing (realization)** 

A state of presence turns into knowing. It is the kind of knowing that no words can describe. It does not require understanding or reasoning. 

You realize your own truth, your own being.  You become detached from labels, outcomes and expectations. You are at peace within and with everything around you. 

**Consciousness** 

Consciousness is the life force within. It is the common connection to all of life. It is the depth of your being, the witness, the creator and the eternal. 

You are fully alive and in harmony with life in this present moment and every moment that follows. 

**Experiencing awareness is more important than trying to understand it on an intellectual level. It is the most inner part of our being.** 

**This does not mean that you can only experience awareness through spiritual practices or traumatic life changing events.** 

**Awareness can be unveiled in everyday living through a slight shift in perception, paying more attention and cultivating gratitude. As we advance in life, we become more aware and more connected to life and all of its expression.**
