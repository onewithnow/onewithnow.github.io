They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

The beholder is the one who gazes, perceives, sees and understands. The beholder is the one who determines what beautiful is—to him or her. 

**Are you the beholder of your own beauty?** 

Who determines how you see yourself and how you feel about who you are? 

**When you look in the mirror, what do you see?** 

Overweight, underweight, crazy hair, puffy eyes, dry skin, oily skin, fashionable, frumpy? All shapes and imperfections are part of what makes you … _you_, beautiful beyond our grasp. 

_Can you see how beautiful you are?_

 **When you think of your amazing life, what do you remember?** 

Triumphs and achievements, loss and defeat, success and failure, rejection and acceptance? All are a reflection in the mirror of your mind—of your inner strength and enduring splendor. 

_Do you remember how beautiful you are?_ 

**When you sail through your days, do you feel how beautiful you are?** 

Angry, sad, happy, elated, tired, joyful, energized, depressed, scared, courageous? All are felt through you and by you. Each emotion is nothing but a drop in the limitless ocean that is you—the experiencer, the feeler. 

_Can you feel how beautiful you are?_ 

**When you listen to the sound of your soul, what do you hear?** 

You are the space in which stillness breathes and silence talks. You are the gap between thoughts and the thoughts between words. You are the exceptional and the mundane. You are all and you are none. 

You are the vastness of awareness through which life expresses itself. 

_Do you hear how beautiful you are?_ 

To be one with life, you need to be one with you—to accept how beautiful you are, to transcend opinions, definitions, standards and otherness. 

**For you are the love of life.** 

And when you _know _how beautiful you are, you behold the truth of all there is—our oneness. You become one with now, and one with all of creation. 

> Do you know how beautiful you are? I think not, my dear. 

> For as you talk of God, I see great parades with wildly colorful bands, streaming from your mind and heart, carrying wonderful and secret messages, to every corner of this world. 

> I see saints bowing in the mountains, hundreds of miles away, to the wonder of sounds, that break into light, from your most common words. 

> Speak to me of your mother, your cousins and your friends. 

> Tell me of squirrels and birds you know. Awaken your legion of nightingales—let them soar wild and free in the sky. 

> And begin to sing to God. Let’s all begin to sing to God! 

> Do you know how beautiful you are? I think not, my dear, 

> Yet I (Hafiz) could set you upon a Stage, and worship you forever! 

> Hafiz

You are the divine spark of life … perfect and complete. You are the dance of creation … sometimes rhythmic, other times not so much, yet eternally beautiful.

You are the one!
