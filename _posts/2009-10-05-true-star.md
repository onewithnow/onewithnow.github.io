Today was another brilliant day. It is incredible how much a good night sleep can improve one's mood. I woke up rested and relaxed. The sunny skies and warmth were energizing and uplifting. 

## The star of everyday life

One of the highlights of today was a visit to Safeway. We were lucky to be checked out by Shirley. The mere thought of her makes me smile. Shirley is a cashier in her sixties. She has been working at Safeway for decades. She has managed to memorize every customer's name who frequents the store. She greets you with a smile and says: how are you today Ms. or Mr. so and so. 

I have yet to see someone who passes by Shirley and doesn't smile. She is not a celebrity admired by millions. But she is definitely a star that brightens the skies of so many people who are lucky enough to meet her. I absolutely love this woman. Maybe one day I will have the guts to ask Shirley if I can take her picture. If I do, I will post it here. 

It maybe a clich√© that **it's not the WHAT, it's the HOW**; but it is a very powerful one. Shirley doesn't look at her job as unimportant and tedious. She gets a chance to interact with people and does her utmost to be the best without taking herself too seriously. She is always smiling and joking (an added bonus). 

**Can I be a Shirley? Can you? I think we all can if we have the desire to try.

## Money matters

Every morning I spend about an hour reading part of SECURITY ANALYSIS. It is a true classic when it comes to investing. The book is huge but worth every minute. The advice is timeless and more relevant today than ever. The more I read, the better I feel about the challenges of the stock market. 

Benjamin Graham (one of the authors of the book) is the mentor of the one and only Warren Buffett. Enough said! 

The most appealing thing about Buffett is not his wealth, but his passion and focus on what he loves the most. **Are you doing what you're passionate about?**
