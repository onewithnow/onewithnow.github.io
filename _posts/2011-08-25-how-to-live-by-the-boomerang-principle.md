> “The game of life is like the game of boomerangs, deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy” ~Florence Skinner

The above quote sums up the boomerang principle. 

A boomerang is shaped to rotate and spin back to the point of its origin. One can view each of our thoughts, words and actions as energy vibrating in a frequency that ensures we get them back—one way or another. 

Today we’ll use the boomerang as a visual tool to gain more awareness into everything we do from intention to action. 

Think of every thought, word or action you take as a boomerang that you throw out. How would this boomerang help you in shaping your reality? 

Take a look at how this simple tool can serve you. 

## Why use the boomerang principle

When you use the boomerang principle, you will benefit in so many ways. Consider the following: 

**Align with the universe** 

You align every aspect of your life with the universal karmic law—you reap what you sow. 

**Prioritize** 

Knowing that what you put out returns to you makes you think twice about what you want to do. What’s the most important boomerang you want to throw now? Do you want to respond to a nasty email? Or would you rather go for a walk? What’s more beneficial to you right in the moment as you get ready to toss your boomerang?  

**Save time and energy** 

Instead of dwelling on why someone said or did something, you allow the universe to reflect back to them what they put out. You don’t waste your breath on things you can’t control. 

**Take personal responsibility** 

Just like you allow others to reap the seeds of their action, you become fully responsible for your thoughts, feelings, actions and reactions. 

**Reduce ego reactions** 

When your ego flares up, chances are you’ll react before you think about it. When you stop—even for a split second—to think before you toss your boomerang, your reactive impulses will subside. 

You get a chance to think before you throw your boomerang. You become aware of your intent, purpose, and the rebounding effect. 

**Cleanse your space and increase awareness** 

When you start thinking in terms of cause and effect, and continue to use the principle, you gradually reduce mental, emotional and spiritual clutter from your life. 

As you reduce the invisible clutter, you become more aware of your environment and life. 

**Accept what is and embrace the truth** 

When you view the world from a place of responsibility and full awareness of your role in shaping your reality, you surrender to life. 

You accept what is. You accept what others did or didn't do as an effect of their boomerangs and not yours. 

## How to use the boomerang principle

The cause and effect law applies in our lives both internally (to oneself) and externally (to others and our surroundings). 

It applies personally in the form of self-fulfilling prophecies. You get the results you anticipate. Externally, what we give to others flows back to us.

All you need to do is to stop before you act or react, ask the following questions and let the answers guide you. 

**1. Why do I want to throw this boomerang?** 

What’s your motivation? Is it to help or hurt? Is it to support or insult? This is very effective in highly reactive situations. If you don’t need to throw it, you stop and save yourself the pain of a negative outcome. 

**2. Am I sure this is what I want to do?** 

Double check that you are fully aware of why you’re doing something. 

**3. Can I use another boomerang?** 

You ask yourself if there is another way, a gentler more supportive way to do or say something. 

I used to think that writing things to take them out of my system was healthy enough. Lately I found that if I used abusive language (even when I’m just venting on paper to myself) the thought still nagged at me. In other words, the boomerang returned almost instantly. So I started reframing my words and that felt better. 

**4. What are the consequences of doing something? How will I feel when it comes back to me?** 

Let’s take the example of self-defeating thoughts like I can’t do this, or I don’t deserve that. When you think of the payback, you won’t want the negative outcome manifest in your life. 

Which brings us to the last question. 

**5. What will happen if I choose not to throw this boomerang?** 

You will be able to stop many thoughts and actions right here. Once you make the decision that you don’t need to think this thought or say or do something, you will let it go. 

Taking the example above, when you ask yourself do I need to think that “I can’t’ do something. What if I just wave that thought goodbye and not allow it to take shape?” Instead, you may say: “ I choose to let this thought go without believing it". 

These questions are simple but powerful. Try to use them on a small part of the tens of thousands of thoughts you have each day and see what happens. Use them more in everyday interactions. 

_Questioning is the best tool to increase your awareness and start a gradual shift in perspective and action._

## A few reminders

We know the law of cause and effect works, but we don’t know all the details of how it works. Consider the following caveats: 

**You can’t predict when your boomerang will return.**

Your boomerang might come right back at you or it may take longer. The same applies to others; you may not see their payback. The best thing you can do is become aware of the boomerangs that you throw and let the rest go. 

**Don’t sap your boomerangs of their goodness with expectations.** 

When you have expectations, you immediately throw a boomerang of conditions along with your boomerang of action (or thoughts and words). You may be setting yourself up for disappointment. The universe works on its own terms to serve the higher purpose of everyone, not necessarily what you expect. 

The more you practice detachment from outcomes the better you’ll get at the boomerang game. 

**You can’t predict the form of the returning boomerang.** 

They say be careful what you wish for. You may throw your boomerang and it may come back to you in completely unexpected ways. However, the end result is the same. You will get what you asked for but not necessarily in the form you expected. 

**Forgive yourself and others.** 

If you throw a boomerang and regret it later, forgive yourself and move on. Dwelling in regret is a sure way of throwing more negative boomerangs. 

Also, forgiving others will stop you from tossing anger and resentment boomerangs. 

You can use the boomerang principle to refine your choices. Better yet, use it as a truth compass and let it guide you to your highest potential and your inner most loving nature.
