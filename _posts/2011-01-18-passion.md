> Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. ~ Harold Thurman Whitman

If I were to pick one aspect of life as a favorite, it would be living with passion—nothing is more near and dear to my heart. I believe living from our highest joy is our main purpose in this journey. 

Passion comes in all shapes in and sizes. There are as many possibilities for living with passion as there are human beings. We all have desires that make our hearts sing—that ignite the spark within. 

Do you know what you’re passionate about? Do you wake up in the morning looking forward to your day? Do you love what you do? Are you at peace with where you are in life and the path you have chosen? 

Living with passion and from your highest joy is the best thing you can do for yourself and humanity. Your passion is the marker of your uniqueness and greatness. No one else is, or will ever be you. 

## Why is passion important?

> Without passion man is a mere latent force and possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark. ~Henri Frederic Amiel

Aside from the fact that it’s your highest joy, here are my top three reasons, which go hand in hand with the philosophy of this blog. 

**Resistance free and surrendered living.** When you live from your passion, everything you do flows effortlessly and joyfully. There are no struggles or obstacles—only exciting challenges and opportunities for growth. 

**Awakened and focused path.** Living with passion awakens you to what’s important. You’re not consumed by a future destination. You’re not easily distracted from your desired path. Instead, you are immersed in doing what you love … day by day … moment by moment. You are living your truth and joy. 

**Peaceful and meaningful success.** Look at all the successful people and you will notice that they do what they love and that’s why they excel at it. Joy is their number one reason for success.  It’s not work to them; it’s life. 

> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. ~Confucius

If you are yearning for something and feel that your life is missing meaning and excitement, then maybe it’s time for you to explore what you’d love to do and be. 

If you think you don’t have anything special that excites you, think again. We all do. But some of us are faster (or luckier) in finding it sooner. The most important thing is to _allow_ yourself to explore the possibilities. 

Opening up to your innate gifts can surprise you—in a very good way. You may find out that all along you were doing something you enjoy and you just didn’t know it. A change in perspective is all that’s needed sometimes to look at your life differently and appreciate what you do. 

In other cases, your journey of discovery might lead you in a very different direction from where you are right now. It takes courage and love to pursue passion—instead of continuing an existence of drudgery and boredom. 

## How to uncover your passion

There are two ways to go about finding out what your passion is. 

**I. The self-discovery route**. Do your own research on living with passion and uncovering your heart’s desires. Depending on your level of commitment and focus, this process can take months, if not longer, to get solid results. 

**II. Leveraging the effort of others**. Learn from others who went through the process before you by using their knowledge and experience. In this case, you can get courses and programs that offer guidance in a simple organized fashion that is easy to follow. 

I recommend the latter approach because it saves you time and money in the long run. Instead of spending months, you can go through the process in weeks and then focus on the part that matters the most: pursuing your passion. 

One course I highly recommend is: 

## Discover Your Passion: A Step-by-Step Course for Creating the Life of Your Dreams by Barrie Davenport

Barrie is a good friend of mine and a brilliant life coach. She has put together a course that covers all aspects of discovering your passion. The course has seven modules and addresses the following areas: 

**1. Your Personality**—takes you through assessments to explore who you truly are behind all the labels and social conditioning. 

**2. Your Qualities**—you go through a process of clarifying your strengths and skills, your values (what’s important to you) and what brings you joy and fulfillment. Barrie also takes you through an equally important exercise of figuring out what you’d like to reduce or eliminate from your life. 

**3. Your Roadmap**—this section guides you through the bigger picture questions—your life purpose, your vision and mission in this life. 

**4. Your Roadblocks**—you answer the questions: what’s holding you back? What’s out of alignment in your life? What are the limiting beliefs and emotional baggage that are keeping you from living to your full potential? 

**5. Your Mindshifts**—explores the subtle everyday experiences you tolerate and what’s missing in your life (needs). 

**6. Your Passion**—you put all the pieces of the puzzle together. This is where you get to see the full picture. 

**7. Your Plan**—the final step is to commit to your passion and start taking action to make it happen. 

## Why am I recommending this program?

I would not recommend anything to you that I haven’t worked with personally. I’ve spent a considerable amount of time reviewing Barrie’s course. I believe it will be of tremendous value to anyone who is serious about discovering their passion and committing to it. Here are my main reasons: 

**Organized all in one guide that saves you time and effort.** All you have to do is focus on doing the work that matters—discovering your passion. You won’t waste any time digging for information. It’s all there in one place. Barrie provides references to other resources when needed that you can access with one click. 

**Depth + specific action steps + worksheets galore.** Every module contains specific instructions and the required worksheets. This makes it easy to apply what you’ve read and put it to work. With every step, you gain more clarity. And no, you won't feel overwhelmed because everything is laid out in a simple organized way. In this program you won’t scratch the surface. You will dig deep into your life till you get to the truth of who you are and what’s meaningful to you. 

**Barrie’s extensive experience.** Barrie is a life coach and someone who personally took this journey and is using her experience to guide you. Regardless of your personal circumstances, you will have access to a wealth of information and experience to lead you through the process. 

If you are serious about the quality of your life and doing what you love, then this course can be a great resource. The material is well organized and infused with personal experience and timeless wisdom. You will answer questions that get you to dig deep and excavate what your heart desires. Barrie is an accomplished writer and knows how to deliver the message in a simple, yet powerful and engaging style.

If you are not ready to commit to a course, I recommend that you visit Barrie’s blog [Live Bold and Bloom](http://liveboldandbloom.com) and read her articles about career and passion. There is a wealth of information there.

You can also check out my previous post about [exploring your heart’s desires](/allow-yourself-to-dream/) and the resources listed at the end of the article.

If you are living your life with passion and enjoy what you do, I’m so happy for you. If you’re not, please give yourself permission to explore and find out what brings you joy—you owe it to yourself and the world.

Whatever option you choose to explore your passion, you have to do the work. No one can do your work for you. So set aside some time and go for it.

Your journey of uncovering your passion may give you something completely new or it might clarify for you what you have been doing all along.  In both cases, you will be more at peace knowing that you are on the right path—the path of your own truth.

> I have learned, that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. ~Henry David Thoreau

You don’t have to change the world or do something huge. You only need to do what you love and experience life from a place of joy at this moment.

Your passion and desires are yours and only yours. You are the artist; your life is the canvas, and passion is your brush. The world awaits your creation.
