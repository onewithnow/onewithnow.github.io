Often times you start on a project, work on it with excitement and then hit the dreaded wall. You feel stuck and don't know where to go or what to do. 

I wrote earlier about [not knowing your purpose](/the-freedom-of-not-knowing-your-life-purpose/) and doing whatever is in front of you at the moment. The same can be applied when feeling stuck. 

Not knowing what to do can be a result of your own thinking. If you are consumed by seeking answers, you will not leave any room for clarity.

## Refocus your action

Instead of focusing on the areas of your life where you don't know what to do next, go to the areas where you know what action to take. 

Let's say you want to write an article. You feel stuck and don't know what to do. At the same time you know you have to do your laundry and get dinner going. 

Start doing the laundry and cook dinner. The process of doing unrelated activities will diminish the seeking. It may open the door to inspiration. 

Even if you don't get any ideas, you still have accomplished two things off your list and can go back and revisit your writing. 

Allowing answers and ideas to come in is very difficult if the mind is full of negative thoughts seeking answers. 

Embrace the clarity that you have, even in the smallest areas of your life. This clarity will open the door to peace of mind and allow answers to show up.

## Letting go is not giving up

It is important to distinguish between letting go and giving up. In the example above, work on your writing project every day. Allocate a chunk of time to sit down and write. If at the end of this time you still feel stuck, then let go and move on to something else. 

The next day do the same thing.Â  Do what can be done and let go. Trust that you are where you need to be. The guidance will show up when it is time for you to move forward.
