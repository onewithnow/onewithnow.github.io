What is a digital sabbatical? It’s taking time off and disconnecting from the internet and its apps—online browsing, email, and social media. 

To me the word sabbatical is associated with taking a long leave of absence to rest or explore. This used to be the case in the physical world but now I feel the need to extend it to our virtual world as well. 

**Why am I taking time off from the internet?** 

Before I go into the reasons, let me share with you my observations about what I’m doing right now. 

**I’m doing it excessively.** The first thing I do when I wake up is click on the little icons on the iPod to check my email and twitter. I don’t take any action but I feel _I have to_ know what’s going on. I repeat this process throughout the day with countless rounds of aimless browsing and searching. 

**I’m doing it mindlessly, most of the time**. I can move from one site to another online for an hour or more without anything to show for it and without a specific purpose, clicking away like there is no tomorrow. 

**It’s becoming a compulsion.** It’s very easy to form the habit of clicking, browsing and checking. And from my experience I can tell you the easiest habits to form are the most non-supportive of our wellbeing—and the hardest to break. I feel itchy when my internet connection is down—seriously! :) 

Can you relate to any (or all) of the above? From these observations, I came up with the following reasons.

## The main reasons to take a digital sabbatical

**1. Have a mind cleanse.** We can use time away from the online world to become more mindful of what we're doing and why we're doing it. 

**2. Reclaim your time.** Taking a break will restore your sense of time, instead of it slipping away from you when online. 

**3. Break the online dependency.** Being away and not relying on the internet will allow you to stop feeding the urge to be connected. 

**4. Create space to do what matters.** Instead of wandering online without a purpose and nothing to show for it, you can spend time doing something of value to you. 

**5. Face the fear of disconnecting.** For me this is something I realized recently. Taking a break will make me challenge the fear of missing out or being left behind in the virtual world. 

## Mental preparation

Preparing, mentally and emotionally, before taking on a new challenge is important. Preparation will reduce your resistance and ease you into the change. Here are the steps I worked out so far. Feel free to add to them. 

**Figure out why you want to take a break.** This is something only you can determine. Think of what you’d like to add or reduce from your daily activities and the benefits you’ll gain from a break. Your motivation has to be strong enough for you to take action. 

**Determine what activities you want to stop.** The biggest ones are: email, twitter, facebook, online browsing, online reading (magazines, blogs, news), videos and shopping. 

**Come up with things to do when the impulse to be online is triggered**. You need to come up with alternatives to replace the behavior you’re trying to stop (checking facebook for example). I’ll explain this more with examples below. 

**What are the things that you want to do with the extra time you have?** It can be pursuing a hobby, writing, spending time with family, starting an exercise program. This is your biggest motivator. 

**Establish a timeframe for your break.** Set your intention and book the time like you’re going on a vacation. Do this at least a week in advance to prepare for the inner adventure. 

**My mental preparation example** 

**Why?** All of the reasons mentioned above. 

**Activities I want to stop.** Email, mindless online browsing (including video), reading blogs, twitter and facebook. I will check email once a week for work only. 

_Note: I will continue to write and publish blog posts. I’ll use an offline blogging client, and automate publishing to social media. I’ll allow myself 25% online research time for work and writing projects._ 

**How I’m going to handle my impulses.** Usually I start clicking away when I feel stuck, mentally tired or bored. I will make a point of moving from the computer, even for a few seconds. Here are some of my alternatives so far. 

- Go up and down the stairs a few times. Or walk on a mini stepper. 
- Check a couple of old papers. And see if I can shred them or if I need to deal with them and do that. 
- Do a simple gratitude meditation. Close my eyes and think of the things I’m grateful for at that moment—no more than a minute. 
- Make a cup of tea or get water.

**Things I want to do.** The main things I want to do are: 

- Write a small report/eBook. I’ve been meaning to do this for a very long time. Now is the time to do it. 
- Set up and use a digital audio workstation. I will create my little music recording system and learn how to use it. I got the hardware, software and the training tools more than a year ago but haven’t done much with them. This is a big motivation for me. 
- Do more of “the sort of” established routines. For example, I meditate in the morning but in the evening, it’s a hit and miss. I want to do it more consistently.

**When I want to do it.** I’ll start on July 1 and continue to the end of the month. This is my intention and I hope I can stick with it. The thought of disconnecting for a whole month scares and excites me at the same time. 

## What if you don’t know what to do with the free time

We all can use more time. I haven’t heard of anyone saying I have too much time. It’s usually the opposite. It’s important to look at where you are, and explore the things you want to do. 

**Here are a few ideas:**

  1. De-clutter part of your home, your car, your office, or your computer files.
  2. Start learning something new, like cooking, programming or playing a musical instrument.
  3. Spend time on a hobby you enjoy.
  4. Practice stillness--just being one with your thoughts and breath.
  5. Take your time doing something without rushing.
  6. Exercise, even for a few minutes. If you can’t do something extensive, just march in place. You’ll be amazed how a few minutes of just marching in place can get your heart pumping.
  7. Read books and watch inspiring movies.

## Physical preparation

After you go through the mental process, you need to get ready, physically, for the journey. 

**Make it harder to be online.** Remove shortcuts, twitter/facebook apps from your digital devices or computer. Consider using a blocker like [freedom](http://macfreedom.com/).

**Get all the tools you need to do other activities.** If you’re going to write, make sure you have an offline program like Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer. Dust off your treadmill, or get your running shoes ready. Make a list of the books you want to read. 

**My physical preparation example** 

Here is what I’m going to do. 

**Making it harder to be online**

- Delete all the shortcut keys I made to the internet browsers on my computer. 
- Change my start page. I currently have a page with the sites I visit frequently. 
- Uninstall TweetDeck from my computer. It’s the app I use most to access twitter and facebook.
- Remove all social apps from my iPad. I’ll move the browser and all the news & video apps to the last page.

**The tools I need for my activities**

- Music software, midi controller, headphones and training video are all set up and ready to go.
- I’ll use Word for the first draft of the eBook. For blogging I will continue to use Live Writer.
- I’ll get all the eBooks I want to read on the iPad in a PDF reader, iBooks or Kindle. And I’ll have the paper books ready in the order I want to read them.

## What I’m hoping to accomplish (what you can expect)

**More freedom**—I want to experience the freedom of not caring about what’s going on online and not following my impulses.

**A renewed sense of my truth outside of the virtual collective**—feeling more grounded, more in touch with what brings me joy and makes me come alive.

**More awareness** of my own behavior and the reasons for the choices I make.

**More creative expression**—be it a book, or a tiny musical experiment.

**Becoming more mindful** when I’m online, and appreciating the experience.

## Final thoughts

This article has run longer than I anticipated. But before I let you go, I want to share with you my thoughts and attitude towards this experiment.

**There is no failure.** I’m committing to one full month—a bit radical—but that doesn’t mean I’ll be able to do it. If I cheat or do it for less, so be it. I will do my best for the duration of the month. Whatever the outcome, it will serve the main purpose of awakening and breaking the cycle.

**Start with what you’re comfortable with.** If you don’t want to do a full month, take a break for a few hours each day (or some days) and move to the entire weekend. Try it and see what happens.

**Tracking progress**—during the entire experience, I’ll journal about how I felt and reflect on my experience every day. Writing things down brings more awareness to the process.

**Keeping it light and flexible**–I’ll do my best not to be harsh or judgmental of myself. I won’t take this experience too seriously. Instead, I’ll try to make it as fun as possible. And if I cheat, I’ll acknowledge it and keep going.

If you’re up for it, join the challenge, even if it’s only for a few hours.
