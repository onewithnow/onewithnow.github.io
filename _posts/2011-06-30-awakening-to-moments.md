> "The happiness of life is made up of minute fractions - the little soon forgotten charities of a kiss, a smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment in the disguise of a playful raillery, and the countless other infinitesimals of pleasurable thought and genial feeling." ~Samuel Taylor Coleridge

These minute fractions are your moments. They are the instant containers of time through which you transform your now. 

A moment is the space in which creation experiences itself. Everything starts with a moment, continues through a chain of moments and ends with a final moment. It’s through these moments that we shape our existence. 

Your experience is the sum of your moments. And life is the culmination of all of our moments. 

## Everything is a moment.

We create in moments and we destroy in moments. We smile, and laugh in a moment. We cry in a moment. 

You grab a cup of coffee, flip a page of a book, change your mind … all in a moment. 

Each word on this page took a moment to construct and a moment to write and it will take you a moment to read.  

A child takes her first step in a moment, tumbles in a moment, and picks herself up in another moment. 

A moment holds the intricacy and the beauty of nature, the simple joys and sorrows of survival—a squirrel jumping, a dog barking, a tree shaking, a man whimpering. 

Each moment is magical and unique. Each moment is a step in our journey, taking us to where we’re meant to go. 

## All moments are created equally.

No moment is too small to notice or too insignificant to experience. The smallest and the biggest of acts are nothing more than fleeting moments. 

The joys of now, the wistful whispers of yesterday and the anticipation of tomorrow are all moments. 

What makes this moment is you—the experiencer. Each one of us perceives and experiences events differently. And as our moments intertwine, we create the world. 

## Awakening

When you take notice of your moments, you start seeing and experiencing things differently. In the space of your awareness, you allow life’s vivid colors and rich texture to come through you and for you. 

Once you appreciate the magnitude of your moments, you begin to see and feel the magic in every being’s moments—true and utter joy. 

This is all we've got in this life—our moments.

Life can't be without moments, and moments can’t be without you. Your moments will continue to vibrate through the eternal now for the rest of creation.
