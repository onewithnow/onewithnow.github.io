The proverb "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" has been used for centuries. We all have good intentions when it comes to what we want to do and achieve. **But what happens if you have the best of intentions but don't do anything about them?** 

The answer is: **you create your own internal hell.** Intentions you don't act on will take mental space and will eat at you until you do something. As you intend to do more things, you add fuel to the inferno. 

What may help in easing the suffering and managing this inner hell is to answer a couple of questions. 

**Do you REALLY desire something and intend to make it a reality in your life? ** 

When you intend to do something, mean it. Don't just add an item to your list without thinking about doing it. 

An item on your to-do list occupies space in your mind. Do you REALLY want to add more to your mind? 

If an item has been on your mind for a significant amount of time and you haven’t done anything about it, do you REALLY want to get it done? What happens if you take it off your list? Is it going to matter in your life today, a month or a year from now? 

**Do you have the mental CAPACITY to handle and add more intentions?** 

Think of your mind as prime real estate that charges very expensive rent. 

If an intention is not acted upon, how long can you let it occupy a unit of your mental property before you evict it? How about giving it a notice and if it is not done by that time, it is gone. 

Your mental space has limited capacity and should be occupied by your BIGGEST and most IMPORTANT desires and intentions. 

If your mental property is well managed, you will have a better chance of acting on what is important and evicting what doesn't pay off.
