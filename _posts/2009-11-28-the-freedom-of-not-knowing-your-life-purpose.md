Wanting to know is a unique trait to us humans. This hunger for knowledge extends beyond our physical world to the depth of our own existence. 

The question of what is my purpose in life becomes paramount after the  [basic needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) have been met. 

Finding a specific path in life comes naturally to some people. Others spend more time searching for a life purpose and may it find or not. 

## My Story

I started on what I thought was a clear path. Went to school, got a degree, had a career. A few years later life became a drag. I was naturally good at what I did but I couldn't bring myself to doing it any longer. 

It took me a few more years to finally make the decision. I kept postponing leaving my career because I didn't know what else I was supposed to do with my life. 

One day, and without any previous plans or directions, I gave myself a deadline that I will resign by a certain date. And I did, and never looked back. 

I traveled, completed various tests and assessments to determine what interested me. The results were a bit of a surprise; but I received no clear direction. I tried new ventures and got out when I started struggling with work. Then went back to  searching for my magic purpose. 

My definition of success was based on  having a clear purpose. Looking at successful people and their focus on what they're doing  in their chosen fields exasperated the seeking. 

## The Revelation 

Then I read Eckhart Tolle's book [A New Earth](http://eckharttolle.com/a_new_earth) and had a true aha! moment.

My purpose in life is what I am doing at the moment. My purpose at that time was to read the book. My purpose prior to that was to seek direction (not necessarily find one). 

> “Have patience with everything that remains unsolved in your heart. Try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books written in a foreign language. Do not now look for the answers. They cannot now be given to you because you could not live them. It is a question of experiencing everything. At present you need to live the question. Perhaps you will gradually, without even noticing it, find yourself experiencing the answer, some distant day.” ~Rainer Maria Rilke

I was finally free. My life was on purpose every moment. Right now my purpose is to write this post. Even the mundane stuff (like brushing my teeth or cleaning the house) started to have a deeper meaning. 

What I found more amazing is how unique my experiences are. Yours are too. No one brushes their teeth like you do.

## Why is not knowing a good thing?

Not knowing what you're supposed to do will keep you open to possibilities. Your direction may change over time as you grow. Every experience is a purpose in and out of itself. Once you think of it that way, everything you do will have meaning and you will do it more deliberately. 

If you are confused as to what you're supposed to do, enjoy your freedom and explore. Have a wonderful journey.
