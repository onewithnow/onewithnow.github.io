I wrote [earlier](/unfinished-business/) about the emotional and mental strain that is caused by unfinished business. Today I want to expand on that and discuss decluttering. 

Clutter to me is anything that sits there day after day and has no use or enjoyment in our lives. It can be furniture, kitchen appliances, books and magazines, clothes, things that are broken and haven't been fixed, computer files or programs not in use. You get the picture. **If you don't use it or enjoy looking at it, you can chuck it or give it to someone who can use it or enjoy it.**

> “People hold onto stuff like their kids' old clothing as a way of holding onto the past. Or they keep things they think they might need someday as a way to control the future.” ~Peter Walsh

Whenever I go through the process of getting rid of stuff, I feel much lighter and at ease. There is comfort in knowing that I made a difference in someone's life. **The lightness of being and the feeling of helping others can be considered spiritual.** 

Getting rid of stuff can provide insights to the **true motivation** for holding on to stuff. So when we experience resistance as we try to cut down, we can see what has been holding us back.  Is it fear, control, or simply not paying attention? 

But that's not all. One of the most important results of decluttering is that you end up with much less stuff. **The less you have, the more time and energy you have to know and enjoy what you own**. In other words having less increases your** awareness** and appreciation of the things that surround you. 

Increased awareness is definitely a spiritual act in my book. It is the foundation to a fuller more authentic life. Would love to hear about your experiences with decluttering. 

To your awareness!
