This is the perfect time to reflect on the year that passed and the experiences that mattered the most. Today I want to share with you what this year meant to me in relation to you—my friends and readers. 

If I would sum up 2010 in one word, it would be connection. 

> “Since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special attention to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstances, are brought into closer connection with you.” ~Augustine

I connected with so many of you and had the privilege of sharing my ideas with you on this platform. 

I want to thank you for giving me your time and attention … for being here right now reading … for taking the time to communicate and express your thoughts. You've been generous in your support, more than I ever imagined. 

I’d like to share with you some of the highlights of my journey with this blog in 2010 and what lies ahead. 

## Looking back at 2010

**Stepping out of my comfort zone** 

Up until 2010, I was apprehensive about sharing anything personal online. While I’m a big fan and user of technology, I wasn’t comfortable being _out there_. 

In February of 2010, I signed up for a blogging bootcamp and unknowingly opened up my life. And that ended up being a good thing. 

I met many talented and kind bloggers. I was also fortunate to be trained by two of the most inspiring bloggers. Taking this blog to a new level required that I share part of myself and my story, not only in what I write, but also in the way I interact with others. 

**Connections magnified** 

Opening up was generously rewarded by a blogging community I’m grateful to be part of. Not only did I learn about the craft of writing and content development, but also about forming meaningful relationships. 

I’ve gained knowledge, confidence and perspective. But more importantly, I gained friends and supporters. This really helped me in moving forward and connecting with you my readers. 

**Slow and meaningful growth** 

With more exposure, the readership grew slowly but surely and that’s the way I prefer to grow personally. 

I was touched by beautiful reactions and feedback. I can’t imagine a better readership than the one I have—supportive, appreciative and genuinely positive. 

**A new design and outlook** I’ve had websites before and a few experiments in blogging but I've never hired a designer. In July of this year, the blog got a new professional design. 

The response was amazingly positive and it reaffirmed the message and purpose of the blog—being at peace and appreciating life in this moment.The feedback motivated me to write with more focus and clarity. 

**Taking a risk and going with gut feeling** 

A few months back, I started toying with the idea of turning comments off. I wanted to keep things simple and focus on writing. 

But I was hesitant to do it. The only blogs that turn off comments are the ones with massive readership and not a growing blog like one with now. 

Then one day I just decided to do it. I felt it was the right time to at least experiment. So in mid November I turned the comments off as a test. 

It’s been more than a month and the feedback has been positive. I haven’t had one complaint about lack of comments. 

So moving forward comments will be permanently off. Here is my logic and if you feel it’s lacking, [drop me a line](/contact/) and let me know.

**1. Maintaining a calm space that’s focused on content.** I like to think of one with now as a place that you visit to read in peace, without distractions and with lots of space for contemplation and reflection. 

My intention is to inspire you to be more at peace with life in this moment. If an idea or article awakens something within you, I hope you take it and run with it—use it in your life now. Write to me about it later, or better yet, share it. 

If you need to contact me, you can always do so by using the contact form or via Twitter or Facebook as explained below. 

**2. Commenting has changed.** From my experience with this site and other sites in similar niches, I noticed that most commenters are bloggers. I estimate no more than 10% of comments to be from readers who are not bloggers. For me, most of the comments I got from non-bloggers were made directly via email. 

Bloggers are a wonderful group of people with a strong sense of community. I’ve had the good fortune to know so many who are supportive and inclusive of all. 

Bloggers can voice their views in various formats other than comments. They can share an article, link to it, or expand on the idea using their own perspective and platform. Other readers can simply continue to use the contact form or social media. 

**3. The evolution of social media**. The way we share information is changing with the exponential growth of twitter and Facebook. 

It will be more advantageous and effective to share articles and views using such mediums. They have a wider reach and continue to grow faster than any individual blog. 

**4. Simplify the reader’s experience.** Saving the best for last. With comments off, you can focus on the article. And if you find the message to be useful you can simply show your support by sharing it. 

I want to make it as simple as possible to enjoy an article and share it with as little time and effort as possible. 

## Where do we go from here?

Moving forward I make the following promises to you. If I don’t deliver, please hold me accountable. 

**1. Content.** I will focus on content that I hope can inspire you in the smallest of ways to accept and appreciate your experience and truth in this moment. 

**2. Free report or eBook.** This is the least I can do to say thank you for your continued support. 

**3. Meaningful interactions by email or social media.** This would be the best way to communicate and share ideas and feedback. 

I want to offer something useful and of value to you in exchange for your valuable time. 

**How can you support one with now?** 

**1. Subscribe by email**. It’s free and easy and will deliver fresh content straight to your inbox. 

**2. Following on[ twitter](http://twitter.com/onewithnow).** I enjoy interacting with friends on twitter. It’s fast and efficient. It’s the best way we can exchange ideas. 

**3. Liking the [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/onewithnow) page.**. This is a new page and I would love to get your support. If you’re on Facebook, I’ll see you there. 

You're always welcome to [drop me a line](/contact/) any time, ask questions, suggest something or give feedback. I love to hear from everyone. 

Again thank you for being part of a kind and generous 2010. I wish you a prosperous and peaceful 2011.
