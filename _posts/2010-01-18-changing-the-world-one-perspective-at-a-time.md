The devastation that hit Haiti was another rude awakening for me. 

My first reaction was: Those poor people. Why does all the misery happen to the same people over and over? 

I was upset, frustrated, angry and feeling sorry for the hundreds of thousands who lost their lives and for the many more who are left behind. 

As I was walking away from the TV, I realized that I was thinking like most people who watch daily news. I was thinking of poor, helpless, unlucky people. 

None of the thoughts I was having were empowering or helpful. I was adding to the misery in my own little way. Viewing people who are faced with adversity as helpless victims reinforces the global belief that they are victims. It is not about positive thinking, but rather viewing the other side of adversity. 

We have been programmed to search for pain like a throbbing toothache. We keep poking where it hurts and of course feel more pain. 

What if we look at the other aspect of natural disasters and what it can bring us? 

What if we focused on the good that comes out of it? Why not think of those people as powerful souls who chose this life and these experiences to teach the rest of us a lesson? 

In times of disasters and catastrophes I believe humanity shows its best side. We are more giving, more compassionate and understanding of one another. We tend to focus on what is really important, which is to protect and cherish life. 

As my perspective changes, I look at the people of Haiti as brave individuals choosing to show us the truth within all of us: we are one. 

To the people of Haiti thank you for the reminder and for allowing me to give. 

The best way I found to contribute is through [Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders)](http://www.msf.org/donate). This site has links to their local offices. 

Let's not feel bad for people and perpetuate the same misery. Let's focus on what unites and inspires us to connect with one another.
