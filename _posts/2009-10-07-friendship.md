Wednesday is usually our day to see our friends. We meet for lunch or coffee, depending on the mood and time of the collective. We met at a pub and spent a couple of hours eating and chatting. 

I laugh more on Wednesdays than any other day of the week. Our friends are of various backgrounds, age, experience and skills. Yet well all share the bond of friendship.

We have a common interest in being good friends. I know that my life is richer, more interesting and more meaningful because of the people I’m proud to call my friends. Each one of them will be there for us, if we ever need help. And I’m sure they know we are there for them. It is an effortless connection. This is when you know that it is the real deal. No one is trying too hard or attempting to force a bond. It just happens naturally over time. 

Every human connection can be tested in rough times and friendships are no exception. But the challenges can be a true testament to how strong the relationship is. The true measure of a good friend is someone who is willing to put up with our own shortcomings but point them out to us at the same time. **We grow and get closer to our true essence with the help of friends.** 

**To all my friends: thank you for being in our lives, thank you for supporting us and more importantly for allowing us to be and grow. We love you.**
