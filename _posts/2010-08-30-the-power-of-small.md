When it comes to size, the consensus is bigger is better—larger homes, bigger cars, fatter bank accounts, supersized meals—the list goes all the way to your dreams. I’m not going to rag on supersized possessions, attitudes or aspirations. What I would like to talk about today is the size of your action steps. 

Is supersized action better than smaller  steps? 

The short answer is no. If you would like to know why small actions and steps are better, keep reading for a small dose of inspiration. 

**Small makes up the fabric of most experiences.** We tend to think of life as a big adventure with lots of wild rollercoaster rides. But in reality, our lives are made up of small steps that add up over time. The wild rides are no more than a blip on the radar of our lives. If you want to enjoy most of your life, you need to appreciate the small experiences from moments, hours, days, all the way to years and decades. 

**Small is the natural pulse of growth.** Everything in life starts small and grows slowly over time. This also applies to intellectual endeavors. We learn and achieve by taking small action over an extended period of time. Nothing happens overnight. 

**Small is the road to big**. No one climbs a mountain or creates an everlasting imprint in this short existence with one giant leap. What gets you there is consistent small action—one step at a time. 

**Small forms habits.** Habits (good and not so good) are created and changed by taking small repetitive action. 

**Small maximizes learning.** It takes short repetitive study sessions to learn a new skill or subject effectively. 

**Small is productivity’s best friend.** If you want to kick your tasks' ass, work in short periods of time by focusing on doing one simple small action at a time. You won't only get things done, but you'll do them well. 

**Small is doable.** When you only think of the one small step you need to take, it is likely that you'll do it right away. It would take you more energy to fret or procrastinate than to actually do it, so you get it done. 

**Small is memorable.** Think of the experiences and memories that stand out in your mind right now. How many of them were from big adventures? For me, the most defining moments came from small daily experiences. 

**Small is manageable.** When it comes to action, success and failure, it is easier to manage smaller steps, victories and setbacks than their larger overwhelming alternatives.

**Small enhances mindfulness.** When you’re focused on a single small action or experience, you give it your full attention and being—you become one with your action in this moment. *Mindfulness is nothing but continued focus on the small now.* 

**Small leads to excellence.** This is a byproduct of short powerful focus and consistent mindful small actions. 

**Small is commitment friendly.** You can commit to doing one simple task that takes you 10 to 20 minutes much easier than committing to something that takes you hours to do. 

**Small makes it easier to adapt.** Gradual smaller steps are easier on the mind and body. They won’t fight back because the change is so small, you won’t abruptly break out of your normal routine. Instead, you’ll build up momentum over time. This is how lasting change takes effect. 

**Small is calmer**. You’re not going to stress out over doing something for 15 minutes. You won’t feel overwhelmed by the size of any project.  You simply break it down to its core tasks, then you focus on the first small task without worrying about the rest. 

**Small is easier to navigate.** When you’re taking small gradual steps, you can see where you’re stepping and where you’re going. You don’t need to look far, just this step and the one after. When you get there, you’ll know what to do next. 

**Small makes it easier to ask for help.** You’ll be more inclined to ask for help when you need a small favor. If you need major help, break it down and ask for the smaller parts first. 

Smaller steps can be your road to achieving anything. 

A small number of projects and a few tasks done well are much better than an overload of tasks and projects that pile up and never get done. 

One or two projects, one or two tasks and one or two hours a day is all you need to start acting on what gives you meaning and joy in your life. 

To your success, one small step at a time!
